        <p>I will recommend you VS Code because it is easy to use and if you are a beginnner you can use it also. VS Code has some additional feautres like  EMMET ABBREVIATON. Which will help you to write long code in short time. Because when you write any letter of any tag or function it will automaticaly display suggestions.</p>

  <h1 class="c">CSS</h1>
  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of programming language which is used to style web pages. The extension of CSS is .css. Without CSS a website can made but it will not look good and will not attract the attension of the user. Thats why it is used by web developers and if you are a web developer you have to also learn it beacuse by learning CSS you can make a beautiful website.</p>
