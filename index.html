          To start HTML first you neeed a code editor. There are many code editors such as visual studio code, sublme text, pycharm, atom, brackets etc. But I will sugest you Visual studio code.

        <h1 class="h" id="t">Why VS Code</h1>
        <p>I will recommend you VS Code because it is easy to use and if you are a beginnner you can use it also. VS Code has some additional feautres like  EMMET ABBREVIATON. Which will help you to write long code in short time. Because when you write any letter of any tag or function it will automaticaly display suggestions.</p>
